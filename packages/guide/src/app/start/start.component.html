            This project is a fan-made project to help <strong>you</strong> enjoying coral island as much as possible.
            In order to do this, this app contains a lot of useful information at hand.
            Those information are either data mined or collected from the community!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                This means this app contains spoilers and information that might not be implemented yet or never
                will be!
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If that's ok for you, proceed your journey and (hopefully) enjoy what I've built :)
