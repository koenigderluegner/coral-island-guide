        <h1>About Coral Guide</h1>
        <p>
            Coral Guide is a project based on Coral Island that started in October 2022, with its first publicly
            available version on 28th October 2022.
            It was intended as a playground for experimenting with new web and framework features, but it gained
            attention by players and turned into a real project.
            The guide includes many information directly data mined from the game to guarantee precision in shown
            information and fast updates if new versions of the game release.
